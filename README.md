This repository will hold code relating to side project code and helpful scripts- may fork this into several repos if this gets too large.

My Dev Environment:

-npm v6.14.4

-node v12.16.1

-elm v0.19.1

-gradle v6.2.1

-java v13.0.2 

-git v2.26.0.windows.1

-intelliJ v2019.3.4

-cygwin v3.1.4

To Run:
Make sure that you have all of the above (or something comparable) installed on your computer and navigate to your local "code-store-toombs" directory. To start up the application on windows run "npm run start-w", to start it up on a mac run "npm run start-m" and then bring up http://localhost:9000/ . Assuming everything started OK, you should see "Hello World", otherwise you will see "Error receiving message from backend.". 

You can start the frontend and backend independently by running "npm run start:frontend" to start up the webpack frontend devServer, and then running the backend code (main class = Application.class) as a SpringBoot application in whatever IDE supports it.
